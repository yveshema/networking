# Network Configuration - Scenario II

**Task**: Create a new router named **test_rtr1** and connect it to the same network as  **r1** and **r2**. Attach another network to **test_rtr1** and configure it such that hosts within the network obtain their IP address dynamically and are able to communicate with any destination.

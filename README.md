## About the course

This course is aimed at introducing you to core networking concepts and implementations through a blend of theory and hands-on practical activities.

The course assumes some familiarity with the Linux operating system and experience with virtualization software. Throughout the term we will implement a virtual network built on top of Linux virtual machines using Virtualbox.
